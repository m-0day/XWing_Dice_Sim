To get an idea how obfuscated the probabilities of certain encounters can get consider this.
The game allows an attacker and defender to roll dice.
The attacker has a 0.5 chance of landing an unmodified hit.
The defender has a 0.375 chance of evading a hit without using dice modifications.
Attackers and defenders may modify one or all of their rolled dice with re-rolls or changing one defender die to an evade.

As of 7 Mar the sim accurately simulates attack rolls with or without re-rolls (target lock) and with or without modification (focus).
